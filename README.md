# A Groovy Guestbook
I've written this app as part of a job application. (Hi Zenjob!)   
It's a simple website with one page where you can leave messages for everyone to read.
* Written in [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
* Built on [Grails](https://grails.org/)
* Postgres as database
* Filters spam through [Akismet's API](https://akismet.com/development/api/)
* Currently, it is deployed [right here](https://zenjobwillyouhire.me/). Come by and say hi!
